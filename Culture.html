                            I was one of the lead performers at the 'All Dormitory Open' House at Vernon Hall Dormitory from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Each room in the dormitory had been decorated in different ways to entertain incoming guests. Me and my roommates decided that we would make a mini horror chamber. Only a party of four people were allowed in the room, and we completely blacked out any sunlight coming into the room so it was pitch dark.
                            ‎
                            We kicked off the event at the Vernon Lobby with a small prayer from Rev. Jonathan Pia. Afterwards, we had a line of tables filled with snacks and sweets for the guests to eat. The atmosphere was festive, with everyone eager to see what each room in the dorm had in store.
                            ‎
                            Shortly after the opening of the event, the guests started to roam around the dorm. My roommates and I were excited for our first party to enter. I remember as the first party entered they were immediately shocked by how dark the room was. They were only given a flashlight with a faint light, and we got to work scaring them as much as possible. They screamed so much to a point that people outside were curious about our room, and soon after the first party left, we were surprised to see a long line outside our room waiting for their turn.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I feel a stronger connection to the community at Vernon Hall. It was a reminder of how events like this can bring people together and create a sense of belonging.

                            I was on the logistics committee for the 'Parada Sillimaniana' at 1:00 PM, representing the College of Computer Studies. My job was to ensure our college's participation in the city parade went smoothly.
                            ‎
                            The excitement was high as everyone from our college gathered with their floats and banners, ready to show our school spirit. The parade was a colorful celebration of Silliman University's community.
                            ‎
                            I was busy organizing our group, making sure we were in the right order, and that all our technology worked for our displays. It was crucial to keep everything on schedule and manage any unexpected challenges that came up.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I've gained a better understanding of event logistics and feel more connected to my college community. It was an eye-opening experience to see how much coordination goes into making our presence in such a large event like the parade impactful and memorable.

                            I participated in the 'Silliman Campus Tour' from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, organized by the Corps of Campus Ambassadors. It was a chance to explore or rediscover the nooks and crannies of our beautiful campus.
                            ‎
                            The tour was led by an enthusiastic ambassador who shared stories and facts about the university's history, architecture, and notable spots. The atmosphere was both educational and fun, with everyone eager to learn more about their school.
                            ‎
                            We visited landmarks like the iconic Silliman Hall, the lush Hibbard Avenue, and some lesser-known spots that held their own charm. It was interesting to see familiar places through a new lens, enriched by the narratives of the guides.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am now more connected to the history and culture of Silliman University. It's made me appreciate the campus's beauty and heritage even more, and I feel more like a true part of this community.
