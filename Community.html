                            I attended AdvocaSIYA: An Advocacy Fair from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, put on by the Silliman University Student Government, where I was a spectator. The focus was largely on women's rights, bringing attention to gender equality and related issues.
                            ‎
                            The atmosphere was charged with a sense of purpose, with booths specifically dedicated to women's advocacy. There were talks, and informational materials all centered around empowering women and addressing gender disparities.
                            ‎
                            I spent my time there listening to speakers, joining in discussions, and learning about initiatives aimed at supporting women's rights. It was eye-opening to see the commitment of fellow students to these causes.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am now more informed about women's rights issues.

                            I participated in the donation of goods and money to the Vernon Hall Janitors. It was a heartfelt gesture by the residents to show appreciation for the janitors who keep our living spaces clean and comfortable.
                            ‎
                            The atmosphere was warm and appreciative, with everyone coming together to acknowledge the hard work of these unsung heroes. The donations included both money and useful items that could make the janitors' daily tasks easier or more pleasant.
                            ‎
                            I helped in handing out the gifts and was touched by the genuine gratitude expressed by the janitors. It was a simple yet profound moment of community and respect.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am now more mindful of the contributions of janitorial staff and feel a stronger sense of community at Vernon Hall. It's a reminder of how small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's day.

                            I was the lead performer at the DOST Blood Donation event at 1:30 PM, organized by the Department of Science and Technology. My role was to donate blood, setting an example for others to follow.
