            <p id ="5C">Silliman University envisions genuine quality Christian education as a result of an interaction of experiences from at least five venues: the Church, the cultural center, the classroom, the (athletic) court, and the community.

                        My church experiences are a collection of moments where I seek peace and connect with my faith. I write about services, talks, and community gatherings that touch my heart or challenge my beliefs.

                        My cultural experiences are a series of events where I dive into different traditions, arts, and stories. I capture how festivals, music, or new foods shape my understanding of the world and myself.

                        My classroom journey is made up of lessons, discussions, and tests. I reflect on specific classes, projects, or conversations that have taught me something new or changed the way I think.

                        My court experience is a string of games, practices, and tournaments. I note the excitement of each match, the lessons from wins or losses, and how playing sports influences my life.

                        My community experience is a collection of local events, from attending events on women's rights to donating blood. I write about each moment of involvement, and how I contribute.
