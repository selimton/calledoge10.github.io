                            I was part of the working committee for the Keyboard Blitz Typing Competition held at the College of Computer Studies from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. My role was to ensure the event ran smoothly, coordinating logistics and assisting participants.
                            ‎
                            The competition was a whirlwind of activity, with participants racing against the clock to achieve the highest typing speed and accuracy. The energy in the room was electric, with everyone pushing their limits to secure the top spots.
                            ‎
                            As part of the logistics committee, I was involved in setting up the computers, managing the timing, and resolving any technical issues that arose. It was a learning experience, seeing firsthand how much organization goes into making a competition like this successful.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am now more adept at event coordination and appreciate the meticulous planning required for competitions. It also made me more aware of the typing skills I need to brush up on, inspired by the speed and precision of the participants.

                            I went to the CCS Softball Tryouts at the College of Computer Studies at 1:00 PM to watch. There were no coaches, so everyone was trying to show off their skills on their own.
                            ‎
                            It was cool to see everyone so focused and trying hard. Without coaches, it was all about self-starting and showing what you've got.
                            ‎
                            Some players were really good, while others were just starting out but had potential. It showed how sports can be about personal effort and team spirit.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I respect how hard sports can be when you're doing it for yourself. It makes me want to cheer on our teams more, knowing how much each player worked to get there.

                            I went to watch the Pasiklaban Volleyball Tournament at the Silliman University Gymnasium from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM as a spectator. It was a spirited event, with teams showing off their volleyball prowess.
                            ‎
                            The energy was high, with players diving for balls and cheering each other on. The crowd's enthusiasm added to the excitement, making every point feel like a mini-victory.
                            ‎
                            It was great to see the teamwork and skill on display, especially from the high schoolers. Their dedication was evident, and it was clear they were all passionate about the sport.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am now more impressed by the talent and spirit in high school sports. It made me appreciate the hard work and camaraderie that goes into each game, inspiring me to support school sports more actively.

                            ‎
                            The place was lively, with everyone cheering for the players as they did these cool flips and kicks. It was fun to see.

                            Sepak takraw was new to me, but it was awesome; it's like volleyball but with some kung-fu moves. It really showed how our community celebrates local stuff.

                            ‎
                            The atmosphere was awesome, with lots of laughs and some pretty intense games. We all had a good time, even if we weren't the best at pickleball.

                            It's like a combo of tennis, badminton, and table tennis, which made it super fun. It was cool to see everyone get involved, no matter how good they were.

                            At first we had started with a short devotion and then had a big dinner. Afterwards the place was alive with talent; as each singer went on stage and showed their talent, and the crowd was all in, cheering and enjoying every moment.

                            I helped with the setup, kept the schedule on track, and did sound checks. It was a lot to manage, but seeing the performers light up the stage made it all worth it.
