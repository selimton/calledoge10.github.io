                            The CCS Opening Devotion was held at the Silliman University Church in the beautiful and peaceful morning of August 19, 2024. The event was held to spiritually enrich and motivate the students and staff of CCS for the upcoming semester. As for my role in this event. I worked as a member of the logistics committee, preparing the things needed for the devotion (gifts & donations for the church), and preparing the free breakfast that was held in UCS which happened after the devotion.
                            ‎
                            I learned a lot about the role of a logistics body in the preparation for this event. Honestly the experience was very smooth, and that’s because of the other people in the logistics committee who were very helpful and committed in making the event a smooth success.
                            ‎
                            I made a lot of new friends and got to further strengthen my bond with the CCS community. It felt really good to help out the community and offer my time to make the experience better for everyone. I now find myself willing to help out whenever I have the chance to as it gives a win-win situation for me and the community.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am a more positive person.

                            The Opening Devotion was held on August 26, 2024, at 1:00 PM, right before the University Parade kicked off. It took place at the amphitheatre which is in front of the Silliman University Church. The event aimed to inspire and set a spiritual tone for the parade. I attended as a participant.
                            ‎
                            The devotion taught me the value of starting an event with a moment of calm and focus. I expected it to be just another routine part of the day, but it was surprisingly grounding. The speaker's words about unity and purpose really resonated with me. It was nice to see everyone from different parts of the university come together for this. The quiet before the parade's excitement was both the most peaceful and the most challenging part, as it made me reflect on my own contributions to our community. This event highlighted my belief in the power of community and shared goals.
                            ‎
                            This experience made me think about how we start our days or events; it's not just about what we do, but how we prepare for it. I learned that a moment of reflection can change the energy of the whole day. I might look into joining the group that organizes these devotions or at least be more active in similar future events. The benefits are clear: it brings people together and sets a positive tone. If I had to do it again, I'd probably arrive a bit earlier to really soak in the atmosphere.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am more conscious of how I begin my day with intention.

                            The Worship Concert by J2MAD was at the Silliman University Church on August 31, 2024, at 6 PM. The event was held to lift spirits and bring the community together through music. I was there just as a participant in the crowd, enjoying the event.
                            ‎
                            I picked up a new appreciation for how music can move you. I didn't expect much, thinking it was just another concert, but it turned out to be a real experience. The way the lights and music worked together was surprising and made the whole thing feel special. One song really stuck with me, giving me a moment of peace. The crowd was a bit much, but the feeling of connection was worth it. It made me realize how much I enjoy these communal moments.
                            ‎
                            This concert changed my view on what worship can be. It wasn't just the music; it was the shared energy of everyone there. I might get involved in some music events or volunteer for setup next time. It showed me the value of community and how music can be a part of that. If I could do it again, I'd definitely try to get there earlier to get a better spot.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I am more eager to participate in community events.

                            We had our Vernon Hall dorm devotion at the Pulido Hall on August 26, 2024, at 6:30 PM, aiming to bring us all closer as a community. I was on the committee, making sure everything went off without a hitch, and I had the privilege of starting the event with a prayer.
                            ‎
                            I picked up some real skills in organizing events from this. I was worried it might be a bit chaotic, but we managed to keep everything flowing nicely. My opening prayer really seemed to set the right mood. There was this one person on the team who was just amazing at keeping everyone calm and focused. Seeing everyone come together felt good, but I won't lie, keeping us on schedule was a bit of a stress. This event reminded me why I love being part of this dorm community.
                            ‎
                            This experience has made me think differently about my role here. I'm keen on doing more to help out, maybe even lead some events. It showed me how much these gatherings mean for our sense of belonging. Next time around, I'll definitely try to listen more to what everyone wants from these devotions.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I feel more connected to our dorm's community spirit.

                            On October 13, 2024, we had this amazing Sunday worship at Silliman University Church, which was also the day they installed our new dorm officers. The event started at 9:00 AM, and the whole vibe was about setting a spiritual foundation for our leaders as they took on their new roles.
                            ‎
                            I went as just a participant, but the experience was way beyond what I had anticipated. The prayers were not just words; they were deeply moving, making it feel like they were speaking directly to us. Watching the new officers get blessed was a highlight, bringing a sense of hope and pride for our community. It was one of those moments where you feel proud to call this place home.
                            ‎
                            This event really made me think about the importance of community support, especially for those stepping into leadership roles. It's shown me how we can lift each other up, not just through the big gestures but through our presence and encouragement. I'm now more motivated to get involved, perhaps help organize future events or simply be there for our officers as they navigate their new responsibilities. If I could go back in time, I'd make a point to congratulate each new officer personally, maybe even share a laugh or a story to ease the pressure of their new roles.
                            ‎
                            Because of this activity, I feel more connected to our dorm's vibe and more eager to play my part in making it a great place to live.
